        "This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project where I am trying to understand a dataset and make visualizations to get inferences on business outcomes through these visualizations. This dataset in about Airbnb bookings in 2019 in New York. It has 48895 rows and 16 colomns. This colomns are id, name containing details of the listing; host_id, host_name containing details of the host; neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, latitude, longitude containing location of the listings; and addional data about the listing like room_type, price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month, last_review, availability_365; and one additional column calculated_host_listings showing number of listings with that host. My job is to understand the data, make a few visualization charts, make inferences from those charts and make hypothesis on how it affects the business model. For this I have loaded the dataset csv by mounting my google drive, cleaned and wrangled the data and made visualizations and charts using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn."
